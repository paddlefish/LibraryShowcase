# LibraryShowcase
Easy-to-use and cool cocoapods

This project contains slides from my March 2017 Cocoaheads MN talk, and a sample project that showcases several of the third-party libraries.

I'm only featuring libraries that are still actively maintained and work really well with Swift 3.

Open slides/index.html to view the slides.

Have a favorite library that I forgot to mention? Send me a pull request and I'll include it.  Just add a link to the index.html file (the slides are built using Markdown.js) and optionally add it to the sample project.

The sample app is built using Cocoapods, and the pods have been checked-in, so it should be a simple matter of build-and-run.
